Welcome to BB8's documentation!
===============================

Welcome to BB8's documentation. BB8 is `Discord <https://discordapp.com/>`_ bot, that provides
useful tools for fans of The Star Wars Destiny game. It's open source and written in Python.
This documentation is split into multiple parts. We recommend that you get started with :ref:`commands`
to get familiar with different commands that BB8 supports and then head to :ref:`instalation` to find out
how to add BB8 to your channel.

If you'd like to dive into BB8 internals, we have :ref:`api` section and if you'd like to contribute
to BB8 check out :ref:`developers` section.
